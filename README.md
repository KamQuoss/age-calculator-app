## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### What I learned

I've learned tha working with Date object is not obvious, and additional calculations must be made. For example 31th of february is valid date, but it is converted to 2nd march. So to solve this problem I've used nickf function presented on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1433119/1293256) to find if date is valid.

Also counting years, months and days is a little bit tricky. At first I've just calculated number of second between two dates (current and past) and calculate how meny years, months, and seconds this is in this result. But during this calculations, I've noticed that you have to assume that year is 365 days (365 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes x 1000 ms), month is 30 days (30 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes x 1000 ms). That gives false calculations, because in reality we have: leap year, shorter february, months with 30 or 31 days. So to show proper numbers, based on common understanding of difference between two dates I've constructed this function:

```js
// current date calculated with build-in methods of Date
let year_curr = parseInt(new Date().getFullYear());
let month_curr = parseInt(new Date().getMonth() + 1);
let day_curr = parseInt(new Date().getDate());

// calculates difference in years, months and days regarding to which day is now
const setNumbers = () => {
  let days_diff = day_curr - d;
  let months_diff = month_curr - 1 - m;
  let years_diff = year_curr - y;

  if (days_diff < 0) {
    days_diff = 31 - Math.abs(days_diff);
    months_diff--;
    if (months_diff < 0) {
      months_diff = 12 - 1;
      years_diff--;
    }
  }

  year_span.innerHTML = years_diff;
  month_span.innerHTML = months_diff;
  day_span.innerHTML = Math.abs(days_diff);
};
```
